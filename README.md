# User Experience
The app will:
* Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.
* Allow your user to change sort order via a setting: the sort order can be by most popular, or by top rated
* Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information.

# API Hints
To fetch popular movies, the app will use the API from themoviedb.org
* /movie/popular: get the popular movies
* /movie/top_rated: get the most rated movies
